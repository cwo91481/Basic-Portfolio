  <div id="paragraph"> 
<p>This is Chuck's feable attempt to design a decent looking webpage.
Now it's time for a commercial break.
Chuck enjoys mingling with local celebrities,
dining at 2-3 star restaurants,
and spends his mid-morning Tuesdays at the local bowling alley.</p>

<p>The internet is full of websites that are either fake,
fraudulent or a scam. Itâ€™s a sad fact of life. 
You see, the evolution of the internet has brought 
with it a number of extremely convenient advances in the way we shop, bank,
and interact with the world around us.</p></div></section>
