<p><img src="assets/images/chuck.jpg" width="150" height="150"> This is Chuck's feable attempt <br>
to design a decent looking webpage.<br>
Now it's time for a commercial break.</p>

<p> Chuck enjoys mingling with local celebrities,
dining at 2-3 star restaurants,
and spends his mid-morning Tuesdays at the local bowling alley.<br> 
The internet is full of websites that are either fake,<br>
fraudulent or a scam. Itâ€™s a sad fact of life. <br>
You see, the evolution of the internet has brought<br> 
with it a number of extremely convenient advances in the way we shop, bank, <br> 
and interact with the world around us.</p></section>
